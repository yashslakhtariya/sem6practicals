fdisk (alternative to mkpart, to create disk partitions)

after it, use partprobe to force kernel re-read the disks

Then mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1 to make xfs filesystem to specified partitions

Then it can be mounted to any dir like mount /dev/vdb1 /tmp/ysl

mount -a : mount all, show if any error on mounting any disks

IMP : After mounting, to make sure the device boots, enter manual entry of the partition in /etc/fstab

UUID can be got by blkid and can be written in /etc/fstab

Then partprobe and reboot

If device reboots successfully, done!

For deleting it,

remove entry from /etc/fstab

then umount /dev/vdb1

then, fdisk /dev/vdb1, then press m for help, first CHECK partition table via p,  then delete the partition

reboot
